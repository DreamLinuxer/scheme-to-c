Scheme-to-C
============

This is a tiny nanopass compiler for compiling a small subset of Scheme into C.
It was developed to be presented at Clojure Conj 2013, in Alexandria, VA.
It is currently not very well tested, as it was only developed a few days ago,
but I promise to return and document it better once the Conj is over. (Really,
I _promise_!)
